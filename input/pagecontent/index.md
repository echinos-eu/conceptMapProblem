### MOLIT Institute

The MOLIT Institute is a research institute for personalised medicine. Its focus is on the development of tailor-made therapies for cancer and their translation into standard medical care. By using the genetic profile of the tumor in a cancer diagnosis, a targeted individual therapy decision is possible. In this way, medicine is moving towards a personalized approach to treatment. MOLIT is proactively involved in
bringing these new medical approaches to patients in oncology. MOLIT does not provide treatment itself, but is only involved in research. In order to establish a link to practice, the institute cooperates with clinics and educational institutions, among others. The support of the Dieter Schwarz Foundation enables MOLIT to focus on independent research and thus on science and the worldwide dissemination of knowledge.
